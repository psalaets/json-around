var objects  = ...

objects.pipe(jsonAround('items', {
  name: 'foo',
  blah: 5
}))
.pipe(process.stdout)

objects.write(1)
objects.write(2)
objects.end(3)

stdout gets:

{
  name: 'foo',
  blah: 5,
  items: [1, 2, 3]
}

everything including first element of array is written as soon as first data chunk
comes in. Once last data chunk comes in array is closed and rest of object is written/closed.
